A Systematic Review of School-Based Interventions Targeting Nutrition and Physical Activity and Body Weight Status of African Children. Multiple databases were searched for studies evaluating school-based interventions of African origin that involved dietalone, physical activity alone, or multicomponent interventions, for at least 12 weeks in duration, reporting changes in either diet, physical activity, or body composition. Language restrictions were not applied. Data fromeligible studies were collected. Narrative synthesis was used to analyse and describe the data. In two African countries, South Africa and Tunisia, studies were generally of low methodological quality. The sample size ranged from 28 to 4003 participants. Two interventions were able to enroll children from both urban andrural areas. The majority of the study participants were elementary or primary school children. The participants were between 12 and 13 years old. All but one intervention was for children of both genders. There were six studies that were pre- and post-test quasi-experiments. The only study that involved the community as a secondary setting was a school-based study. The interventions ranged in length from four months to three years. The interventions focused on weight related behaviors. Three of five studies that evaluated weight status were inconsistent in their results, as were three of six studies that reported physical activity outcomes. It was not possible to make definite conclusions about the effectiveness of the studies. This study has identified research gaps in the childhoodobesity literature in Africa and strengthened the need for further studies, the findings of which would contribute valuable data and inform policy. Overweight and obese people are major public health threats. Between 2000 and 2015, the prevalence of childhood overweight increased by 50%. Almost 40 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2016 and most of them lived in Asia and Africa. The consequences of childhood obesity, which may be apparent even early in life, include increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. In a systematicreview and meta-analysis of studies involving children and adolescents in Africa, Noubiap and colleagues reported that elevated blood pressure was associated with body mass index. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in children who were overweight than in children who were normal weight. There have been reports of psychological issues such as stigmatisation and low self-esteem. There is a need for a multi-disciplinary approach that focuses on the diverse environments in which children live. The evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effectiveness of school-based programmes has been mixed. The evidence comes from high- to middle-income countries. A systematic review of studies from low- tomiddle-income countries concluded that school-based programmes are promising in improving the health of body weight. The generalisation of their findings to African countries is a challenge because only one African study was included in that review.
